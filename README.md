# SrsAutoLogin v0.1
SrsAutoLogin is created to get rid of the relatively tedious login process of Bilkent University Srs System

Only support Mozzila at the moment

Since the verification code is automatically fetched from mail inbox, your verification code should be sent to your mail address,
not to your cell phone.

<strong>Caution!</strong> Since this program is automating something that is used for security, pelase keep in mind that it has the risk of account theft. Remember Cridentials button saves your login/pass locally to a text file after an encription. Changing the encription code in srs_crypt.py should be sufficient, but I am not a rapper so beware.

This is my first python project ever, so the code is most likely sloppy to an extent that makes you wonder how the hell does it even work
(maybe it doesn't, I am the only tester)
